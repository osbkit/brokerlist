# Contributing to This Repository

If you have a broker you'd like to add to the list, please
[submit a pull request](https://github.com/osbkit/brokerlist/compare)
that adds your broker to the bottom of [THELIST.md](./THELIST.md).

We want to ensure that this list has high-quality brokers so it's useful for
everyone. So, we prefer PRs that add brokers that are actively maintained.
