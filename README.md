[Open Service Broker](https://www.openservicebrokerapi.org/)-compatible
service brokers.

_Important note: This repository is not affiliated or sponsored by any one
individual or company. Like everything in open source, it's a group effort._

# Why?

We work on several OSB-related projects, and have heard quite
a few folks asking if there's a list of brokers they can choose from for
their application.

In this repository, we attempt to maintain a list of useful brokers for you
to select from. Keep in mind, however, that we aren't trying to track *every*
broker in existence.
